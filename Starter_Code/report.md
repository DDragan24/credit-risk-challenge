## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

* Explain the purpose of the analysis.
The dataset used was consisted of 77,536 loans. Included in the data was loan_size, interest_rate, borrower_income, debt_to_income ratio, number_of_accounts, detorotort_marks, total_debt, and loan_status. Attempted to predict the loan_status column. remaining colomns useed to train the program to find correlating predictions.
* Explain what financial information the data was on, and what you needed to predict.
* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).
* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.

* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any other algorithms).


## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
    * Accuracy Score: 99%
    Precision Scores
    Class 0 (healthy Loans): 100%
    Class 1 (High-Risk Loans): 85%
    Recall Scores:
    Class 0 (Healthy Loans): 100%
    Class 0 (High-Risk Loans): 85%

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:

* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
